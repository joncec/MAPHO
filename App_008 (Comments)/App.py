# Comments are lines, wich are ignored by the Python interpreter (doesn't run Comments).
# Examples (Single line comments):
# In Python, Single-line comments are created via hash.

# keeps the miles traveled
miles_traveled = 10000

print("Miles traveled:" , miles_traveled)

# average speed = displacement / change in time

# getting the displacement
displacement = 450 #km

# then get the change in time
change_in_time = 6 #hr

# calculate the average speed
average_speed = displacement / change_in_time

print(average_speed)

# Examples (Multiple line comments):
'''
In Python, Multi-line comments are created
via two(triple) quotes, as in this case.
'''

# \n = new line
multi_line_text = "Line 1 \nLine 2\nLine3"
print(multi_line_text)

print("Hello my dear\nPython")

'''

        This is line 2
            This is line 3
'''
print
